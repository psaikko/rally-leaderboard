# rallyboard

This is a serverless REST API based on the [example tempate](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-node-rest-api-with-dynamodb).

## Structure

This service has a separate directory for all the todo operations. For each operation exactly one file exists e.g. `todos/delete.js`. In each of these files there is exactly one function which is directly attached to `module.exports`.

The idea behind the `todos` directory is that in case you want to create a service containing multiple resources e.g. users, notes, comments you could do so in the same service. While this is certainly possible you might consider creating a separate service for each resource. It depends on the use-case and your preference.

## Use-cases

- API for a Web Application
- API for a Mobile Application

## Setup

Install and configure [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

```bash
npm install
```

## Deploy

In order to deploy the endpoint simply run

```bash
serverless deploy
```

## Usage

You can create, retrieve, update, or delete todos with the following commands:

### Create a Todo
